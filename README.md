Concept:

ABSTRACT AI FUNDING ALLOCATOR

Using artificial intelligence, NGOs can quickly access a specific set of potential donors, that are matched to their cause. In order to do this, the AI will search the internet, including blogs, news portals and donor websites, for funding that is targeted to their cause. It will also scan the web for similar websites that fall in the same category as a donor organization site to increase its search range. It checks the authenticity and ranks the searches based on how valuable it is for the users of the app (by grant size, the estimated time required to allocate the fund, the location and the deadlines). Then the user of the app can press on a button (a picture of the organization donor along with the grant size written in bold) and apply for the funding. The application form will be filled out automatically, so the user does not have to fill out the same form for each funding opportunity. 
The AI will use the data given in the registration of the NGO to automatically fill the form and send the application to the donor. NGOs can add new information or change their data if needed. The AI also uses the user account information to inform potential donors about the NGO’s current projects and future plans, toward the end goal of a more persuasive application. If additional information is required, then the AI alerts the user management staff from the NGO. The AI will use the data to learn what type of applications are more frequently successful and then uses this data to increase the application quality and provide recommendations to the NGO. Highlight: This feature enables an NGO to automatically apply for grants from a targeted selection of donors, who are more likely to accept their application, without having to go through the time-consuming task of searching for funding on the web. 
The potential developments for this idea include using AI to give the NGO feedback on their applications, using the rejections and acceptances of previous funding applications. There is also the possibility of using the site to connect NGOs of similar causes, as this will especially be aimed at small and early stage NGOs. 

Proposal to X5GON

X5GON could be used for by the AI if there is a database of information about potential donors that can be accessed in future. There is also potential for X5GON to be used in the application guidance that will be offered to NGOs.

The website also contains a help page that features a video as to how to use it and also a helpline to help users by phone or by email with certain issues.
